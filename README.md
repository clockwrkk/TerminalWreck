# **TERMINALWRECK**  
*The loudest, filthiest, most dangerously fun terminal-based web game you’ve ever fucking played.*

Welcome to **TerminalWreck**—a psychedelic car crash between a hacker war room and a cursed game of Jackbox hosted by a gremlin with a megaphone and a grudge. If Google Docs got blackout drunk with 4chan, took acid, and started screaming into a terminal window, this would be the baby.

**It’s multiplayer. It’s fast. It’s broken in the best way. And it only gets worse the longer you play.**  
Don’t ask if it’s safe for work. If you have to ask, you’re already too soft.

## **WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?**

TerminalWreck is a browser-based, terminal-style party game that slaps a bunch of demented game modes together like a bundle of live wires. You play it with friends, enemies, or that one cousin who thinks they're the funny one.

## **GAME MODES**

**Bombparty** – Spell or perish. Think typing game meets pressure cooker. No spellcheck, no mercy.

**PromptPanic** – Speed-type unhinged prompts before your brain melts. Creativity rewarded. Shame guaranteed.

**Evil Admin** – It’s *Among Us* if it were hosted on a cracked Raspberry Pi by a sysadmin with anger issues. Sniff out the traitor or become them.

**Backdoor** – Fake a Wi-Fi network. Set a trap. Watch fools walk into it. Guess passwords. Get hacked. Hack back. It’s digital warfare with none of the consequences.

**PromptPanic: After Dark** – **NSFW. NSFL. WTF.** This is where the wheels fall off. Prompts written like Kanye tweets on ayahuasca. Pure chaos. For adults with no future.
