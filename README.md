# TERMINALVOID

**The edgiest, loudest, most brain-melting terminal webgame ever built.**

What if Jackbox got blackout drunk at DEFCON, SSIX dropped acid in Google Docs, and the whole thing was livestreamed on a 4chan thread owned by a malware-riddled porn site?

Welcome to **TERMINALVOID.**  
A chaotic multiplayer terminal simulation where nothing makes sense, and voice chat makes it worse.

## FEATURES

- **Terminal UI**: Fake hacking, real screaming.
- **Voice Chat**: Powered by mediasoup. Because Discord is for cowards.
- **Game Modes**:

  - **NEURALFIRE**: Write like your sanity depends on it. Someone’s reading your darkest thoughts.
  - **SYS_ADMIN HACKFEST**: It’s not just Among Us. It’s a goddamn hack fest.
