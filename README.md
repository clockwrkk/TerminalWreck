# TERMINALWRECK

**The game that makes you feel high, drunk, and mentally compromised at the same time.**  
Welcome to **TerminalWreck** — the multiplayer fake-OS terminal party game where *chaos isn't a bug, it's the entire point*.

### What the hell is terminalwreck?

**TerminalWreck** is if:
- Jackbox got dosed
- Google Docs got hacked
- 4chan and a porn site raised a child together
- And Vencord injected Steam Workshop with brainrot

All wrapped in a fake-ass terminal OS that boots into war. You log in, you make a name, you enter a room — **and you're immediately dropped into CHAOS MODE.** It's a chat. It's a warzone. It's a game. It’s your new guilty pleasure.

### Features

- **Fake Terminal Interface**  
  Terminal-style login, customizable names and tags, edgy OS wallpaper, and cursed animations.

- **CHAOS MODE**  
  Start typing commands like `sudo apt uninstall your_friend` and watch the world burn. Use `/leave` to rage quit like a legend.

- **Admin Panel**  
  Choose games, mute, kick, ban degenerates, or turn on **Streamer Mode** to censor the unspeakable.

- **Voice Chat (Mediasoup-based)**  
  Built-in VC for raps, trash talk, and live breakdowns.

### Game Modes (All SFW & NSFW Compatible)

- **PromptPanic** / **Prompt Panic After Dark**
- **Evil Admin** (Among Us-style backstabber)
- **Backdoor** (fake hacking, real chaos)
- **Turnt Tweets** (say the most outrageous shit — *you decide who wins*)
  - Includes **No Filter Mode** and **Depraved Mode**
- **Story or Death** (write short stories and get shuffled around, then roasted)
- **RAPOVERTHAT** (VC rap game — freestyle, fill-in-the-blanks, absolute mayhem)

> most game modes support custom decks as well as the normal and nsfw decks.

### New Unhinged Additions

- **Custom Terminal Mods**  
  GeoCities theme? PornHub skin? Meme sound effects? Go wild.

- **Command Roulette**  
  Roll `/roulette` for random curses, glitches, or powers.

- **Propaganda Generator**  
  `/manifesto` generates insane AI-generated rants about your tag.

- **Our economy but better because fuck tariffs.**  
  Earn **Bits of RAM** to unlock dumb cosmetics like lag particles or boot-up sound effects.

- **Personality Injection**  
  You get a title based on behavior: *Prompt Prophet*, *Certified Rat Bastard*, *Terminal Degenerate*.

- **Friend-Sabotage Plugins**  
  Curse your friends with mods that autocorrect their chat or flip their UI upside down.

- **AI Voice Announcer**  
  TTS bot that randomly reads chat in chaos mode. Can be banned if it gets too real.

- **Terminal Bugs**  
  Type `sudo apt install brainrot` to break your UI with absurd effects.

  Self-hosted LAN chaos with zero censors and 100% plug-and-play insanity.
