# TERMINALWRECK  
### _The World's Greatest Worst Idea™_

**TerminalWreck** is a browser-based multiplayer terminal from hell.  
You make an account, spin up a room, hop on VC, and absolutely **lose your mind** with your friends.

It’s a **game**, it’s a **chatroom**, it’s an **OS**, it’s **Jackbox on acid**, and it's probably breaking like three digital Geneva Conventions.  
**Built for chaos. Designed for the unhinged. Welcome to the terminal.**

## WHY?

Because nothing else was stupid enough to try this.  
Because sometimes the best ideas come from the **worst intentions**.  
Because Jackbox is too clean.  
Because AnuraOS didn’t go far enough.  
Because we wanted to make a game that actively tries to kill you while you laugh with your friends.
