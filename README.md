## **What is TerminalWreck?**

**TerminalWreck** is a multiplayer terminal-based environment where you can:
- Create an account, make a room, and bring your friends in for some chaotic terminal fun.
- Use voice chat (VC) to communicate in real-time while you break, build, or just mess around in your own digital playground.
- Engage in a variety of modes like free play (no rules, just vibes), Jackbox-style mini-games, and hacking challenges. It's basically a terminal-based game jam that never ends.

### **The World's Greatest Worst Idea**
Why is it the world's greatest *worst* idea? Because we combined terminal commands, voice chat, games, and total chaos into one wild package. It's as dysfunctional as it sounds, and we’re here for it.

## **Features**
- **Create Rooms**: Spin up a room for you and your friends to hang out in, use the terminal, or play games.
- **Voice Chat (VC)**: Jump into voice chat with your friends and talk (or yell) in real-time while you type away.
- **Free Play Mode**: Go crazy. Type whatever you want. No rules, no structure—just pure, unadulterated terminal madness.
- **Jackbox-inspired Mini-Games**: Participate in goofy, competitive mini-games straight from your terminal. No need for fancy graphics—just a lot of typing and ridiculousness.
- **Hacking Game Modes**: Test your skills with puzzles and challenges that’ll make you feel like a hacker in a 90s movie (minus the Hollywood magic).
- **Rust-like Long-Term Game**: Start from nothing, build, hack, and collaborate in a persistent world where the game doesn’t end. Ever.

## **Game Modes**
- **Free Play Mode**: No rules. Just chaos. Type commands, mess around, and have a good time.
- **Jackbox-esque Games**: Answer prompts, vote on responses, and compete in terminal-based mini-games.
- **Hacking Challenges**: Dive into puzzles that test your problem-solving skills and make you feel like a digital outlaw.
- **Rust-Inspired Persistent World**: Create, destroy, and hack your way through a world that never resets. Build up your progress, invade others, or form alliances.
